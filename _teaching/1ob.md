In this course students learn about the discipline of sociology, including its historical development, its main theories and methods, and its range of topics. We also study how sociologists develop theories, formulate research questions, and collect and analyze data to understand how humans behave in various contexts, as well as how societies change over time. We examine topics such as social interactions, culture, ecology, power, globalization, race, gender, sexuality, inequality, crime, social movements, and revolutions.
