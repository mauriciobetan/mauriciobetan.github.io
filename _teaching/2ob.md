The aim of this course is to analyze the interrelation between communities, the environment, and society, with an emphasis on the ecological and socioeconomic crises in the Anthropocene. The central theme is to explore how to create a just and sustainable society. The course will serve as an introduction to the broad range of issues addressed in environmental sociology as a field. A specific focus will be given to interconnections between current lived lifestyles (_e.g._ the city/country divide, cars and cities, and production and consumerism) and questions of environmental justice and sustainability.
