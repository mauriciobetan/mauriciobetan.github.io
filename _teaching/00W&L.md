This course studies the nature-society relationship in the colonial and modern world by analyzing the history of instrumental raw materials that have been commodified as part of the development of capitalism. Drawing on dependency, unequal exchange, and world-systems theories, we examine commodity chains and trade relations between the Global North and the Global South, with an emphasis on ecological and social issues. We also analyze environmental justice topics related to these episodes, as well as possible paths to transcend the asymmetric cross-national power relations characterizing the modern world. The course is also intended to help students develop your analytical thinking, writing, research, and communication skills.
