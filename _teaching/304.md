The aim of this course is to analyze the interrelation between communities, the environment, and society, with an emphasis on the ecological and socioeconomic crises in the Anthropocene. The central theme is how to create a just and sustainable society as well as how to develop a rational relationship with the rest of nature in todayâ€™s world. You can find the syllabus of the class [here](http://mauriciobetan.github.io/files/SOC_304_S22_Syllabus.pdf).
