The aim of this course is that students learn about the interactions between humans and the environment. This will involve issues from a diversity of disciplines including anthropology, biology, economics, geography, history, and sociology. We explore how human societies affect the environment, and, in turn, how they are shaped by it. Students learn to recognize, understand, and discuss the basic ecological structure and dynamics of the Earth and its ecosystems; the cultural, ecological, and economic bases for ecosystem value; the role of stakeholders in shaping the causes, consequences, and solutions to environmental problems; and the essential background of environmental issues and their potential solutions. In addition, they learn how to apply perspectives from the natural and social sciences and the humanities in analyzing environmental issues, present concise summaries of environmental issues based on evidence, utilize reliable literature to support their arguments, and draw solid conclusions supported by evidence. The course is also intended to help students develop their analytical thinking, writing, research, and communication skills.
