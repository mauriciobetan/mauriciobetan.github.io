“He is an excellent teacher, he knows a lot about the class's topics and he loves them, so he also transmits that love for philosophy to you…one of the best professors I have had in the Faculty, so I totally recommend [the class].”

“He is an excellent teacher. He knows a lot about the subject and answers any questions that may arise. He likes students to get involved, but he doesn’t force you to participate. He is critical when grading, but he is fair. You are going to love each and every one of his classes and when you are done taking them you will want to return.”

“I very rarely email professors any feedback on courses, but I have to say that this course has taught me so much and I am so thankful that I took it. I am an environmental studies minor and this was the final course to complete my minor requirements (also my favorite). I feel like I have learned more about environmental movements and climate change through this course than have a variety of ENVS classes combined.”

“I couldn’t be any more appreciative of your understanding response, it really shows how much you care about your students given all you have done for not only me personally but the class as a whole given these extreme and unusual global events. It is teachers like yourself that truly leave positive impacts on us as students.”
