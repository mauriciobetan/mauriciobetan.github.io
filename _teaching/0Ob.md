In this course students learn about the discipline of Sociology in the Global South, with a special emphasis on Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). We examine the works of several influential scholars, political figures, and activists, all emanating from and situated in LAC, Africa, or Asia. We study topics such as ecology, power, dependency, world-systems, unequal exchange, decolonization, liberation pedagogies, class, race, gender, feminism, food sovereignty, indigenous social movements, and revolutions. By the end of this class, students are familiar with the key discussions in Sociology, other social sciences, and the social movements that have arisen in the Global South _vis-Ã -vis_ decolonization and environmental justice. This class grants Cultural Diversity because of its focus on cultures outside the United States.
