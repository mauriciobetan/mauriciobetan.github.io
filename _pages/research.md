### Hydropower, agriculture, and methane: the social effects of dams amid a changing climate
<i>Amanda Sikirica, <b>Mauricio Betancourt</b>, and Nick Theis </i> 

We assess whether hydroelectric power development influences agricultural methane emissions. Despite the fact that environmental sociology has enjoyed a wealth of research on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, little has examined agricultural emissions, and even less so agricultural methane emissions, the second most important GHG, whose relevance in relation to climate change is increasingly important. In order to establish the effects of hydroelectricity on agricultural methane emissions, we estimate three fixed-effects panel regression models on all nations with available data from 1975-2008, which we then split by high and non-high income categories to investigate variation in effect by affluence. We intend to send this piece to _Energy Research & Social Science_.

### The ecological bases for economic processes: South American guano formation and commodification
<i>Mauricio Betancourt </i>

This work examines how geophysical and ecological conditions provide the foundation and context for global trade by studying the processes whereby guano is formed off Peru and Northern Chile.

### An Agroecology Project in Zaachila: synthesizing an experience  
<i>Mariana Benítez, Cristina Alonso, Cecilia González, Emilio Mora, Emilio Petrone, <b>Mauricio Betancourt</b>, </i>, Adriana Uscanga, Alexandre Beaupré, Benito Vázquez, Tania Lara, Luis Bracamontes, Sergio Hernández, Diego Contreras, Ana Laura Urrutia, and Kyria Valladares.

Using information obtained through semi-structured interviews, in this book chapter, we synthesize the experiences of peasants in Zaachila, Oaxaca, regarding their adoption of agroecological techniques and their involvement in a local agroecological project we were part of.

### Collective decision-making: Deliberation in small groups vs. the Wisdom of the crowds
<i>Joaquin Navajas, Tamara Niella, Gerry Garbulsky, Bahador Barhami, Mariano Sigman </i>

In a crowd experiment on a 10,000 people audience at TEDxRiodelaPlata, we studied whether a crowd made better estimations when people made estimations 
individually vs. in small independent groups where deliberation and consensus took place.

### Cooperation and the zero-sum game fallacy 
<i>Tamara Niella, Nicolas Stier, Mariano Sigman</i>

In a crowd experiment on a 10,000 people audience at TEDxRiodelaPlata, we studied why people do not engage in cooperation, even when it pays off, and how context and instructions can influence that behavior.

### Moral judgment of tattling in Argentina: the effect of different types of incetives and a person's intrinsic corruption
<i>Tamara Niella, Isabel Rocca, Mariano Sigman</i> 

Investigation on Argentinean adults’ moral judgment of tattling -the reporting of another person’s violation of a normative expectation to a third party- and the effect of two kinds of incentives on it. It is possible that in the decision making process, two opponent moral values come into play: the benefit of maintaining loyalty to an authority vs. the cost of breaking loyalty to a peer. We examine the hypothesis that there are certain variables that may alter this trade-off. Through an interactive questionnaire we found that loyalty to the authority may be perceived as a cost while maintaining loyalty to a peer seems to be more relevant. In different situations where the following factors varied: the seriousness of the transgression, the relationship between peers, and the existence or not of incentives to tattle; we found a generally negative insight towards tattling, and a resistance to like the “tattler” even when her action is well judged. This negative insight is intensified when there is friendship involved or when the transgression’s seriousness is low. We also found that a punishment-type incentive nudges willingness to tattle more efficiently than a prize-type one. In a second experiment, we identified "corrupt" participants from those who were not, and although there were no differences between their judgment on tattling, differences in their attitudes were found: corrupt participants would tattle less than non corrupt ones.
