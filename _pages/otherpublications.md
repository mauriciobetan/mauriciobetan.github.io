### Betancourt, Mauricio. 2021. "El papel de la ciencia en la URSS: un esbozo de la ecología y las ciencias ambientales soviéticas." _Palabras Pendientes_ 14:70-77.

I provide an overview of some scientific and environmental developments in the Soviet Union, such as the concept of biogeocoenose, the biosphere, and some forest conservation policies. You can find this article (in Spanish) [here](https://tejiendorevolucion.org/pp14bet.html).

### González, Cecilia, Cristina Alonso, Emilio Mora, <b>Mauricio Betancourt</b>, Adriana Uscanga, and Mariana Benítez. 2017. "Modos de producción agrícola y conservación de la biodiversidad en México." _Biodiversitas_ 132:3-6. 

This article examines two intertwined crises: the food crisis and the loss of biodiversity crisis. Commonly, each of these problems is addressed in an isolated --an even antagonistic-- way, when in fact both are deeply interconnected. We analyze the relationship between agriculture and biodiversity conservation in Mexico, focusing on the effects of different modes of agricultural production upon the dynamics of fragmented biotic communities in the landscape. You can this article [here](https://ia801605.us.archive.org/23/items/biodiversitasno13comic/biodiversitasno13comic.pdf). (in Spanish).
