I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Sociology at University of Oregon, where I am completing my dissertation entitled _Ecological Imperialism: A Holistic Analysis of the Guano Trade in 19<sup>th</sup>-century Peru_, under the supervision of Prof. [John Bellamy Foster](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=anEkFkEAAAAJ&hl=en) (advisor), [Richard York](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oIRDUjAAAAAJ&hl=en), [Matthew Norton](https://sociology.uoregon.edu/profile/mnorton/), and [Carlos Aguirre](https://history.uoregon.edu/profile/caguirre/) (History). This research uses the nineteenth-century guano (bird dung) trade between Peru and Britain (and also France, Germany, and the United States) as an empirical case to answer questions related to unequal economic and ecological exchange, food regime development, world-systems, and migration, labor and health. 

I obtained my M.A. in Sociology at the University of Oregon, writing a paper where, through a longitudinal, cross-national comparison of agricultural practices in Latin America and the Caribbean, I suggest that agroecology has contributed to improve soil quality in Cuba, the country where this approach to food production is more widespread. This work was published in _Global Environmental Change_ in 2020 and can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378019306703?via%3Dihub).

Prior to my studies at the University of Oregon, I received my first M.A. in Philosophy of Science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where I studied aspects of the nature-society relationship under different socioeconomic systems by means of applying social theories. You can find this research [here](https://repositorio.unam.mx/contenidos/438592). 

I also received my B.Sc. in Biology from UNAM, where I graduated _Summa Cum Laude_ and, in my bachelor's thesis, examined the literary, scientific, and sociopolitical origins of environmentalism in the United States and its Development During the Cold War. This work can be found [here](https://tesiunam.dgb.unam.mx/F/GEPTVJ4YN5482SG8EH8GPTYPATJU7HME5PSFDGP4H5V7S7PCXF-06435?func=full-set-set&set_number=721826&set_entry=000003&format=999). While obtaining my B.Sc. Biology, I was an exchange student at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia, where I took courses on analytical biochemistry, biocomplexity, and plant biotechnology.

I have taught courses on Environmental Sociology and Climate Change (SOC 304 _Community, Environment, and Society_) at the University of Oregon, as well as on _History and Philosophy of Biology_ at UNAM. I also have a long trajectory of rural work, having been a literacy teacher for seven years (2006-12) across several communities in Mexico, and later on co-founding and participating in an agroecology project in Zaachila, Oaxaca, Mexico (2015-2018).
