I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Sociology at University of Oregon, where I am completing my dissertation entitled _Ecological Imperialism: A Holistic Analysis of the Guano Trade in 19<sup>th</sup>-century Peru_, under the supervision of Prof. [John Bellamy Foster](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=anEkFkEAAAAJ&hl=en) (advisor), [Richard York](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oIRDUjAAAAAJ&hl=en), [Matthew Norton](https://sociology.uoregon.edu/profile/mnorton/), and [Carlos Aguirre](https://history.uoregon.edu/profile/caguirre/) (History). I am interested in the interactions between economy and ecology, environmental sociology, and global environmental change. So far, my research has focused on humanityâ€™s impact on the environment, agriculture and global food systems, and unequal exchange and development. Other than this, I am interested in conservation biology and evolution, social theory, and environmental history. I utilize quantitative and historical methods.

I obtained a M.A. in Sociology from the University of Oregon and my first M.A. in Philosophy of Science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I also received my B.Sc. in Biology from UNAM, where I graduated _Summa Cum Laude_. While obtaining my B.Sc., I was an exchange student at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia, where I took courses on analytical biochemistry, biocomplexity, and plant biotechnology.

I have taught courses on Environmental Sociology and Climate Change (SOC 304 _Community, Environment, and Society_) at the University of Oregon, as well as on _History and Philosophy of Biology_ at UNAM. I also have a long trajectory of rural work, having been a literacy teacher for seven years (2006-12) across several communities in Mexico, and later on co-founding and participating in an agroecology project in Zaachila, Oaxaca, Mexico (2015-2018).
