I am an Environmental Sociologist studying the nature-society relationship, global environmental change, and unequal development. Currently, I am an Assistant Professor in Environmental Studies at Washington and Lee University. My research and teaching focuses on agriculture and global food systems, humanityâ€™s impact on the environment, and unequal exchange and development. Other than this, I am interested in social theory, environmental history, conservation biology, and evolution. I utilize quantitative and historical methods.

I obtained my Ph.D. and M.A. in Sociology at the University of Oregon (UO), and my first M.A. in Philosophy of Science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I also received my B.Sc. in Biology from UNAM, where I graduated _Summa Cum Laude_. While obtaining my B.Sc., I was an exchange student at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia, where I took courses on ecology, biochemistry, and biotechnology.

I am currently teaching _Introduction to Environmental Studies_ and _The Commodification of Nature_ at W&L. In addition, I have taught courses on Environmental Sociology, Sociology of the Global South, Empires and Unequal Development, Environmental Justice, and Climate Change at Oberlin College and the UO, as well as on History and Philosophy of Biology at UNAM. Moreover, I have a long trajectory of rural work, having been a literacy teacher for seven years (2006-12) across several communities in Mexico, and later on co-founding and participating in an agroecology project in Zaachila, Oaxaca, Mexico (2015-18)
