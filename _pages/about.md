I am an Environmental Sociologist studying the nature-society relationship, global environmental change, and unequal development. Currently, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in Sociology at Oberlin College. So far, my research and teaching has focused on agriculture and global food systems, humanityâ€™s impact on the environment, and unequal exchange and development. Other than this, I am interested in social theory, environmental history, conservation biology, and evolution. I utilize quantitative and historical methods.

I obtained my Ph.D. and M.A. in Sociology at the University of Oregon (UO), and my first M.A. in Philosophy of Science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I received my B.Sc. in Biology from UNAM, where I graduated _Summa Cum Laude_. While obtaining my B.Sc., I was an exchange student at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia, where I took courses on ecology, biochemistry, and biotechnology.

I am currently teaching _Introduction to Sociology_ and _Environmental Sociology_ at Oberlin. In addition, I have taught courses on Environmental Sociology, Environmental Justice, and Climate Change at the UO, as well as on History and Philosophy of Biology at UNAM. Moreover, I have a long trajectory of rural work, having been a literacy teacher for seven years (2006-12) across several communities in Mexico, and later on co-founding and participating in an agroecology project in Zaachila, Oaxaca, Mexico (2015-2018).
