Along with Prof. Victor Wallis and Prof. Fred Magdoff, I discuss how climate change has brought about a multi-pronged environmental crisis that seems to get worse every day and how we can we transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy and restore biodiversity. In addition, we discuss what will it take for environmental movements to force changes in governmental and corporate policies.
